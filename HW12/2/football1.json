  "content": "Jose Mourinho's Manchester United pulled a seemingly impossible result out of the bag on Wednesday, scoring twice in the final five minutes to turn an impending 1-0 defeat to Juventus into a 2-1 win in Turin. Mourinho was clearly pleased. The Portuguese boss took to the pitch after the full-time whistle, cupping his ear to the Bianconeri fans in a gesture which he says was a response to abuse he received throughout the game. `I was insulted for 90 minutes,` Mourinho said after the game, via the Guardian's Barney Ronay. `I do my work and nothing more. At the end I didnâ€™t insult anyone, I just did the gesture that I wanted to hear them more. I wouldn't do it again. But I came here as a professional that does his work and people insulted my family, this is why I reacted this way. I don't want to think about it.`He added, according to The Telegraph's James Ducker: I probably shouldn't have done it, and with a cool head I wouldn't have done it, but with my family insulted, including my Inter family, I reacted like this. `Admitting that his actions weren't the wisest idea is likely a reaction to the situation Mourinho has found himself in over the past few weeks.",
