  "content": "BATE Borisov came close against Chelsea - cracking the woodwork on three occasions - but the English side advanced to the Europa League knockout rounds with a 1-0 win in Belarus. Meanwhile, Arsenal qualified for the next phase courtesy of a concurrent match in central Ukraine, while last season's finalists Marseille and Belgian giants Anderlecht were eliminated from the continental competition. A draw between Ludogorets and AEK Larnaca did neither side any favors, as their dropped points and Bayer Leverkusen's 1-0 win over FC Zurich led to the duo's elimination. Leverkusen and Zurich are even on nine points with two matches remaining.",
