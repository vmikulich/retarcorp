  "content": "Manchester United face a 'challenge' to re-establish themselves as the top team in Manchester after falling behind their bitter rivals, according to Nicky Butt. The 3-1 derby defeat to Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday saw United slip 12 points behind Pep Guardiola's champions. City have won two Premier League titles since United's last success in 2013 and Butt, the club's academy boss after 12 decorated seasons as a player, admits they have been overtaken in their own city. 'For Manchester United now we have got a challenge on to get back to where we want to be, which is the biggest club in the country, but also in the city,' Butt told the Premier League Sports Network event. 'That challenge is there for the owners, the board, the manager and the club in general to be where we want to be. And, to be honest, we have got a challenge on our hands to get there.' Butt lifted the Champions League trophy with United as part of an unprecedented treble in 1999, while City won the playoff final to escape the third tier of English football.",
